## Test Coverage

The E2E tests comprehensively cover the user scenarios defined in `docs/4-user-scenario.md`:

1. **Player Flow Testing:**
   - Theme selection and game initiation
   - Hint code validation and display
   - Session recovery mechanisms
   - Error handling for invalid inputs
   - Duplicate hint prevention
   - Time limit management

2. **Admin Flow Testing:**
   - Admin authentication (hidden entry mechanism)
   - Theme management (create, update, delete)
   - Hint management (bulk creation, updates)
   - Session monitoring

## Technical Implementation

- Tests are located in `test/E2E/` directory
- Player scenarios in `player-scenarios.spec.ts`
- Admin scenarios in `admin-scenarios.spec.ts`
- Playwright configuration in `playwright.config.ts` 
- Reports are generated in the standard Playwright HTML format

## Execution Command

To run these tests, use the following command from the project root:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

## Report Generation

Test reports are automatically generated by Playwright in the `test-results/` directory and can be viewed with:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Notes

The tests have been written to match the exact specifications in the user scenario document. All selectors and user flows follow the UI elements and interactions as described in the documentation. These tests ensure both happy path and error path scenarios are validated.
